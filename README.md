# Simple Card Game

## Overview

This Java Swing-based card game allows players to bet, replace cards, and compete against the dealer. The player and dealer each receive three cards, and the player can replace up to two cards from their deck. The winner is determined by the most special cards (J, Q, K) or, in a tie, the highest total value of non-special cards modulo 10. The deck is shuffled after each bet. Players can input their bet, replace cards strategically, and enjoy the game's interactive features. The game includes a graphical user interface with buttons, labels, and images to enhance the gaming experience.
