# SimpleCardGame
A Java Swing game where the dealer and player get three cards, betting until funds run out. After each bet, the deck shuffles. Victory is decided by special cards (J, Q, K), or the highest total value of non-special cards modulo 10 in a tie. Players can replace up to two cards for added strategy. The dealer wins if neither condition is met.
